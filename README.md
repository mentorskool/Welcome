To start with, let's go through the below steps to get you onboarded :

### Step 1 : Vision of Mentorskool

* <a href="https://forms.gle/HDYnohjVAzxZKoY66" target="_blank">Quiz-01</a>
* <a href="https://forms.gle/YqdMokCSUmDd7dXh7" target="_blank">Quiz-02</a>



### Classroom
---------------------
By now, you would have already seen the holistic list of skill sets a **Full Stack Data Scientist** is expected to have. (Check <a href="https://github.com/mentorskool/Welcome/blob/master/docs/learning-paths.pdf" target="_blank">**here**</a>) <br>
Now, based on where you stand today, pick the topics most relevant to you from below : <br>
